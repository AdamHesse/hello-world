# hello-world
My first GitHub repository.
I am Adam Hesse. 
I am a Master's student in Financial Mathematics at King's College London. 
I'm using C++ and MATLAB to build derivatives pricing libraries.
On my MSc project I am using stochastic control to optimise dynamic trading strategies.
I will be learning how to use Python for design algorithmic trading strategies.
I hope to incorporate machine learning into my trading projects.
